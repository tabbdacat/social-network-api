# Social Network API

## Description

This application demonstrates the fundamental functionality of a social network API. It uses input provided in order to create, retrieve, update, and delete data through routes for users, their thoughts, and reactions to their thoughts. The API also maintains a friends list which can be updated. It uses MongooDB, a noSQL database to store data. The application also demonstrates associations between users, friends, and their thoughts/rections to link correlated data in multiple documents and subdocuments. 

While developing this website, I learned about noSQL databases and the flexibility of storing data in a non-relational document database as compared to SQL databases. I also strengthened my skills in CRUD operations and Postman for testing APIs.

## Usage

Review the Walkthrough Video which demonstrates functionality of this social network API application. The video includes how to start the application's server, use of the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes being tested in Postman for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting users; adding and removing friends from the friends' list; creating, viewing, updating, and deleting thoughts; and posting and deleting reactions to a posted thought.
